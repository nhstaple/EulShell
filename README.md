## Description
This is an aggregated repository of that one is expected to learn during their undergraduate career studying Computer Science. This project originally started as a way to wrap [**_Project Euler_**](https://projecteuler.net/) solutions through an intuitive interface.

The name comes from the Swiss mathemtician [**Leonhard Euler**](http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Euler.html). See the [Wiki](https://github.com/nhstaple/EulShell/wiki) and [release](https://github.com/nhstaple/EulShell/releases) for the development history.
