# EulShell - Development Branch
This is the devleopment branch for EulShell. This is where the current development process takes place.

#### 6/13/2019 Added initial shell class, [commit]((https://github.com/nhstaple/EulShell/commit/1166157fcf4601e7244adcc8200325e485c2b3ba)).
Added the initial code for the abstract class [`Shell`](https://github.com/nhstaple/EulShell/wiki/Shell). [`EulShell`](https://github.com/nhstaple/EulShell/wiki/Shell) derives and implements [`Shell`](https://github.com/nhstaple/EulShell/wiki/Shell). [`EulShell`](https://github.com/nhstaple/EulShell/wiki/Shell)'s _virtual_ methods with a majority of them as placeholders for future stages. This interface is due to change and will be documented in the wiki.
